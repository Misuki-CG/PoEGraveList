# PoEGraveList

A handful tool allowing you to manage the corpses needed for your craft in Path Of Exile : Necropolis. 

## Context
PoE Grave List is a tool made for the Action-RPG game called Path Of Exile. On March 29th, the league "Necropolis" has been released which introduce a new mechanic : corpses craft. 
While Craft Of Exile already give an opportunity to simulate and determine how to manage corpses in order to craft a specific item with a high probability, it doesn't provide any "shop list" of the different corpses needed to craft the item. 

Then I decided to make my own tool so I can manage easily which corpses type I need, how much, and how much I already have in my morgue.

### WPF Choice

Beside the technical context, I've always heard about Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) from Microsoft and MVVM logic, but I never took time to learn it. As this project seems complex enough to learn lessons from implementing MVVM and getting in touch with WPF, I opt to let it a go. 

This is the only real reason behind this choice.
